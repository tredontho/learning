# Functional Programming In Scala

This project is just working through exercises from the [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala) book.

Currently I'm using Scala 2.13, as Scala 2.x is largely what we use at work,
but hopefully I can find a nice way to incorporate Scala 3 as well (might
require just having a separate project -- hey, more learning)
