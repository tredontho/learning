Previously I had repos scattered all over, one for each book or coding exercise website, etc. I'm hoping that combining them into a single repo will simplify some things... who knows.

# Advent of Code
Working through the problems from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) - each year should have its own directory

# Crafting Interpreters
Following along with the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book.

# Functional Programming in Scala
Working through exercises in the [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala) book.
