Previously I had repos scattered all over, one for each book or coding exercise website, etc. I'm hoping that combining them into a single repo will simplify some things... who knows.

# Advent of Code
Working through the problems from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) - each year should have its own directory

# Codeforces
[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com) is another programming problem website - some folks on Twitter
indicated that the problems were more "real-world" than e.g. leetcode problems


# Crafting Interpreters
Following along with the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book.

# Functional Programming in Scala
Working through exercises in the [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala) book.

# LeetCode
Attempts/solutions for [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems

# Optics by Example
Working through exercises from [Optics by Example](https://leanpub.com/optics-by-example)
